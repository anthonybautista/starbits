        <h2>StarBits - An Experimental ERC20</h2>
        <a href="https://starbits.xyz" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">
            Contract Address
        </a>
        <br/>
        <a href="https://starbits.xyz" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">
            Initial Liquidity Burned
        </a>
        <h3>Concept</h3>
        <p>
            StarBits implements a 10% transfer tax on most transactions (buying from the LP does not!). This tax is used
            to swap for BTC.b, and every time at least 0.1 BTC.b is accumulated, one lucky address will be sent that BTC.b!
        </p>
        <p>
            That's right! If this token can sustain liquidity and usage (which is no guarantee, of course), participants
            have a chance at being airdropped BTC.b!
        </p>
        <h3>Tokenomics</h3>
        <p>
            This token has a capped supply of 21,420,000 - allocated as follows:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>320,000 Creator Allocation</li>
            <li>4,200,000 Initial Liquidity</li>
            <li>
                16,900,000 Price Containment Liquidity (PCL)<br/>
                <i class="notice">NOTE: PCL is stored in the token contract and programmatically added to the liquidity pool to prevent early
                    exponential token price increases and make providing liquidity easier for early entrants.</i>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <h3>How to Participate</h3>
        <p>
            There are two ways to be eligible for the next BTC.b drop:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>Selling or transferring the token, which incurs a tax, will earn you 1 Star Power. This can be done once per 24 hours.</li>
            <li>
                Staking LP tokens. If you provide liquidity, you can stake those LP tokens to accrue 1 Star Power per 1 AVAX in LP per 24 hours.<br/>
                <i class="notice">NOTE: Star Power from staking fluctuates as the value of the LP fluctuates, and must be claimed every day.</i>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p><b>1 Star Power is 1 entry in the drawing. When it is time to pick a winner, Chainlink VRF will select one
            entry and send that address the BTC.b. More Star Power = more chances to win!</b></p>
        <div id="liq">
            <p class="warn">Please note that while providing liquidity gives more chances to win per day, it comes with significant risks.</p>
